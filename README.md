# Personal Portfolio
Live site can be found at [Michaelhuang.ca](Michaelhuang.ca).

Designed using Figma, built with Next.js, styled with Tailwind CSS, served with Contentful, and deployed with Vercel.

## Motivation
My first few portfolios were somewhat of a creative abstraction in terms of design. Privileged to have experienced the efficiency of development that comes with well designed mockups from working with expert designers, I challenged myself to create this portfolio in adherence to a full Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).

## Local Demo

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies by running the command `npm install`.
3. Start the development server by running the command `npm run dev`.
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the project.

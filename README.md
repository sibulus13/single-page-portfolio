# Personal Portfolio
Live site can be found at [Michaelhuang.ca](Michaelhuang.ca).

Designed with Figma, built with Next.js, content served with Contentful, and deployed with Vercel.

## Motivation
My first few portfolios were a creative abstraction at best in terms of design. Having the privilege of experiencing the efficiency of development that comes with well designed mockups from working with expert designers, I challenged myself to create this portfolio in adherence to a full Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).

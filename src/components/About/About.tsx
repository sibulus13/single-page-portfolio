        robot for my degree. Seeing the impact of those lines of code sparked my
        interest in software development, it was love at first sight. A few

        Systems Engineering with a minor in AI, I was ready to take on the world
        of tech.

        I take pride in building robust software that are both functional and
        aesthetic. In my free time, I enjoy automating the mundane things, and
        dabbling in new technology.

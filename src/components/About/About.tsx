        Back in 2016, I wrote my first program to breath life into an autonomous
        robot for my Mechatronics degree. Seeing the impact of those lines of
        code sparked my interest in software development. A few years later,
        credited with a Bachelors of Applied Science in Mechatronic Systems
        Engineering with a minor in AI, I was ready to take on the world of
        tech.

        Today, I have the privilege of amassing a diverse software development
        journey, I have completed many project life cycles for my school, a
        leading global provider of clean energy solutions, a robotic start-up,
        and a data-driven farm wealth solutions platform.

        I take pride in building robust software that are both functional and
        aesthetic. In my free time, I enjoy automating the mundane things, and
        dabbling in new technology.

        When Iâ€™m not tinkering away at my computer, you can find me fidgeting
        with photography, exploring the mountains, riding through the twisties,
        or mastering the ukulele.
